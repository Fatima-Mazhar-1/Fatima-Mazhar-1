**I am a Computer Science graduate from FAST-NUCES with a growing interest in UI/UX design and human-centered experiences. My journey started with programming, but over time I discovered how much design impacts usability and how a well-crafted interface can completely change the way people interact with technology.As a UI designer, I focus on creating clean, simple, and accessible designs that not only look good but also make sense to the user. I enjoy working with tools like Figma and Adobe XD, where I can translate ideas into wireframes, prototypes, and interactive designs. My process involves understanding the userâ€™s needs, exploring different design approaches, and refining until the interface feels natural and effortless.I believe design is not just about colors or layoutsâ€”itâ€™s about solving problems. Whether itâ€™s improving navigation, reducing complexity, or making apps usable for everyone, I approach each project as an opportunity to learn and improve. Alongside UI design, I keep exploring areas like usability testing, accessibility, and responsive design, which are essential to building experiences that work for real people in real situations.**
